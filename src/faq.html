  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h2>How do I add a new task?</h2>
    <p>Use the form at the top of the homepage. Enter a name, optional category, deadline, and priority. Then click "Add task".</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h2>Can I edit a task after creating it?</h2>
    <p>Yes! Click the "Edit task" button below a task. The form will fill with that task's details so you can make changes.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h2>What happens when I mark a task as completed?</h2>
    <p>The task gets visually updated and is pushed to the bottom of the list. You can undo it by clicking "Mark as incomplete".</p>

    <p>If you want to remove a task from the list, simply press the "Delete task" button. Note that once a task is deleted, it <strong>cannot</strong> be recovered!</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h2>Where is my data saved?</h2>
    <p>Your tasks are saved in your browser's local storage. This means they stay on your device, even if you reload the page. However, they won't sync across devices or browsers.</p>

    <p>However, you can <a href="#json-import-export">export your tasks as a JSON</a> and import them later to prevent losing your tasks.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h2>Can I download a file containing my tasks?</h2>
    <p>Yes! Click the "Download tasks" button to download your task list as a plain text file. You can also click the "Export tasks as JSON" button to download your tasks as a JSON file.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h2 id="json-import-export">What's the point of exporting my tasks as a JSON file?</h2>
    <p>A JSON file stores your tasks in a structured format that's easy for computers to read. Exporting to JSON lets you import your taks into the planner later. It keeps all task details like deadlines, categories, and completion status.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h2>How do I search or filter tasks?</h2>
    <p>Use the search bar to filter by name or category. You can also filter by category using the "All categories" dropdown menu.<p>
    <p>The dropdown menu on the right of the page also allows you to filter tasks by due date, priority and alphabetical order.</p>
  </div>
